***RDA Interest Group Draft Charter Template***

***Name of Proposed Interest Group:***  Computational Notebooks  

***Introduction*** *(A brief articulation of what issues the IG will
address, how this IG is aligned with the RDA mission, and how this IG
would be a value-added contribution to the RDA community):*

Notebooks, specifically Jupyter notebooks (but also notebooks from platforms such  as RStudio) are generating a great deal of excitement and are  potentially a significant step forward in terms of reproducibility,  education, code documentation and academic publishing. A recent[ paper](https://github.com/rdanotebooksbof/outline/blob/master/www.ic.uff.br/~leomurta/papers/pimentel2019a.pdf) found nearly 1.2 Million unique notebooks based on searches through github; another even more recent [blog](https://kyso.io/KyleOS/nbestimate) gives evidence of nearly *5 Million notebooks* on github.

This is colossal growth amongst use by researchers. **The RDA absolutely needs to engage with this as it enables both sharing of data and software.**

More recently the deployment of resources such as[ JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub),[ myBinder](https://gke.mybinder.org/) and[ EGI notebooks](https://notebooks.egi.eu/hub/login) mean that notebooks can be deployed on a cloud and hence obviates  issues with installed libraries. One potential result of this is that it would represent the easiest pathway for users to use cloud computing  resources for research which could transform the use of such resources.  It is clear that frameworks such as EOSC and the US National Data  Service will make extensive use of notebooks and their offerings  affected by them. 

The proposed Interest Group will build on the BoF meetings held on this topic. A set of topics (discussed in detail in the objectves below) has been arrived at that a) would make a tangible contribution to the notebook community and b) make use of the configuration of expertise within the RDA community that would not be available elsewhere. Briefly these are 

- Publishing notebooks
- Long term preservation of notebooks
- Notebooks as FAIR digital objects
- Notebooks for Big data and compute 

The RDA community benefits from this as it provides an opportunity to shape how this rapidly expanding technology is deployed and used.  

 

***User scenario(s) or use case(s) the IG wishes to address** (what
triggered the desire for this IG in the first place):*

As noted above there has been a rapid expansion of the use of notebooks. They present an opportunity to enable sharing of data and code and potentially reproducibility. Most of all the analysis of data is made more *understandable* for researchers. These opportunities are tempered by corresponding challenges. Notebooks are not entirely software and not entirely data. Reproducibility is strongly dependent on the availability of libraries. The following still has to be developed -  an approporiate mechanism for publishing notebooks; guidelines on how to preserve notebooks and how to make notebooks themselves more FAIR; how to enable batch systems in notebooks for HPC.  A host of challenges exist, both in terms of implementation and in terms of guidance that the RDA community could advise on.  

***Objectives** (A specific set of focus areas for discussion, including
use cases that pointed to the need for the IG in the first place. 
 Articulate how this group is different from other current activities
inside or outside of RDA.):*

The objective of this IG is to allow a forum to discuss topics related to notebooks that will have an impact and is not being carried out elsewhere (specifically as it draws on the competences of the RDA community). The following topics have been identified that fit these criteria. We note that these draws on the expertise of other groups within the RDA but  is different from their acitivities.

- Publishing notebooks - specifically to consider what are the necessary steps (such as the provision of metadata standards, guidance and integration with, for example, the PID graph). This would draw on the experiences of th [Software Source Code Identification WG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/software-source-code-identification-wg), the  [Software Source Code IG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/software-source-code-ig) and the [Virtual Research Environment IG (VRE-IG)](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/vre-ig.html). 
- Long term preservation of notebooks - specifically to consider the steps necessary to preserve notebooks on a time-scale of up to ten years, as opposed to their usual degradation after about two years. This could include providing guidance on preservation and making decisions on the level of preservation. This would have overlap with Software IG and WG mentioned above and the preservation-related groups within the RDA.
- Notebooks as FAIR digital objects - specifically on how to make notebooks themselves more FAIR (including workflows that use notebooks) and issues such as licencing issues/guidance when data sets are one licence but the notebook is another.
- Notebook for Big data and compute - specifically to address the following questions - how to provide scalable batch computing from notebooks; how can we ensure reproducibility from different JupyterHub installs and what are the community's best practices?

***Participation** (Address which communities will be involved, what
skills or knowledge should they have, and how will you engage these
communities.  Also address how this group proposes to coordinate its
activity with relevant related groups.):*

\*     *

***Outcomes** (Discuss what the IG intends to accomplish.  Include
examples of WG topics or supporting IG-level outputs that might lead to
WGs later on.):*

This IG will consider the four initial topics and determine how specific WG's could be built out of them. The outputs from this IG will be a set of WG proposals. 

***Mechanism** (Describe how often your group will meet and how will you
maintain momentum between Plenaries.):*

The IG will have a call once every two months. A [github repository](https://github.com/hughshanahan/RDAComputationalNotebooks) has been set up which will be used to put together WG proposals.

***Timeline** (Describe draft milestones and goals for the first 12
months):*

February 2020 - Initial call

March 2020 - RDA Melbourne plenary

May 2020 - Call to review WG proposals

June-August 2020 - submission of initial round of WG proposals

September 2020 - Call to prepare for RDA San José

October 2020 - RDA San José plenary

November 2020 - Call to review WG's and consider if additional round of WG's are necessary. 

January 2021 - Call to discuss progress.

***Potential Group Members** (Include proposed chairs/initial leadership
and all members who have expressed interest):*
